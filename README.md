• Just Blink is an Open-Source application that uses OpenCV to keep track of Blinks and runs on PyQt5 GUI.

• It notes the average blinks and notifies the user to blink more often if the average is low, doing so results in reduced eye strain. 

• It allows the user to track their progress and see improvement over a period of time.

• It allows the user to easily create and switch profiles.

• It also has a built in pomodoro timer to encourage you to take breaks, which increases both productivity and to give your eyes a rest.

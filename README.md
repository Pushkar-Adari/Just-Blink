<h2>Introduction</h2>
Ever had blurry vision after staring at a screen for a long time?<br> That might be because on average you blink 60-70% less when using a computer. This can cause dryness that may be the reason for discomfort and blurry vision.<br><br>
Just Blink aims to solve just that using OpenCV to tracks blinks and sends you notifications when it falls below a certain threshold.
These notifications aim to help you make a habit of blinking more frequently to keep your eyes hydrated and ultimately combat digital eye strain. <br>
<br>
Aside from that Just Blink includes a Pomodoro Timer with customizable session lengths combined with notifications to remind the user to take much needed breaks to boost productivity.<br><br>

• Just Blink is an Open-Source application that uses OpenCV to keep track of Blinks and runs on PyQt5 GUI.

• It notes the average blinks and notifies the user to blink more often if the average is low, doing so results in reducing eye strain. 

• It also allows the user to track progress over a week and see improvement.

• It allows the user to create multiple profiles in case of a shared computer.

• It also has a built in pomodoro timer to encourage you to take breaks, which increases both productivity and makes time for eyes to rest for a bit.
